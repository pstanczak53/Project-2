	<h1>About me </h1>
		<br>
		<h3>Hello to my fellow friends and student from IIT</h3>
           <p>My name is Peter Stanczak, and I am a transfer student. After successful graduation with Associate degree of Information System Security from College of DuPage;
		      I am currently seeking bachelor degree of ITM in IIT. I have many interests which I have no time to pursue in the moment because of my full commitment and total engagement in IIT. 
		      Some of these interests are: building a RC plains and Drone Racing. Not many people know that Drone Racing is becoming a new high speed sport, among many computer, engineering savvy individuals.
		      Some of this costume built copter-drones excciding speed up to 120 mph! I hope you also find this interesting, please watch video below.
